    =  Lynis 2.1.1 (2015-07-22)  =

    This release adds a lot of improvements, with focus on performance, and
    additional support for common Linux distributions and external utilities.
    We recommend to use this latest version.

    * Operating system enhancements
    -------------------------------
    Support for systems like CentOS, openSUSE, Slackware is improved.

    * Performance
    -------------
    Performance tuning has been applied, to speed up execution of the audit on
    systems with many files. This also includes code cleanups.

    * Automatic updates
    -------------------
    Initial work on an automatic updater has been implemented. This way Lynis
    can be scheduled for automatic updating from a trusted source.

    * Internal functions
    --------------------
    Not all systems have readlink, or the -f option of readlink. The
    ShowSymlinkPath function has been extended with a Python based check, which
    is often available.

    * Software support
    ------------------
    Apache module directory /usr/lib64/apache has been added, which is used on
    openSUSE.

    Support for Chef has been added.

    Added tests for CSF's lfd utility for integrity monitoring on directories and
    files. Related tests are FINT-4334 and FINT-4336.

    Added support for Chrony time daemon and timesync daemon. Additionally NTP
    sychronization status is checked when it is enabled.

    Improved single user mode protection on the rescue.service file.

    * Other
    -------
    Check for user permissions has been extended.
    Python binary is now detected, to help with symlink detection.
    Several new legal terms have been added, which are used for usage in banners.
    In several files old tests have been removed, to further clean up the code.

    * Bug fixes
    ---------
    Nginx test showed error when access_log had multiple parameters.
    Tests using locate won't be performed if not present.
    Fix false positive match on Squid unsafe ports [SQD-3624].
    The hardening index is now also inserted into the report if it is not displayed
    on screen.

    * Functions
    ---------
    Added AddSystemGroup function

    * New tests
    ---------
    Several new tests have been added:

    utility to create host ID. Group check have been altered on AIX, to include
    the -n ALL. Core dump check on Linux is extended to check for actual values
    as well.

    * Software
    ----------
    McAfee detection has been extended by detecting a running cma binary.
    Improved detection of pf firewall on BSD and Mac OS. Security patch checking
    with zypper extended.

    * Session timeout

  =  Lynis 2.0.0 (2015-02-25)  =


  The first release within the 2.x branch! It includes several new features, to
  simplify or improve auditing on Unix based systems, including BSD, Linux,
  Mac OS and more traditional systems like AIX, HPUX and Solaris.

  New features and many improvements are the reason for the bump to a major
  release, also a beginning of a new era. Many tools to audit or harden systems
  have being released, yet none have been maintained over a long period of time.

  * Support and Feedback

  This software is supported and under development by CISOfy. By providing a
  dual license, this software is kept up-to-date and enhanced. Both customers
  and the community, benefit from this licensing. This release is available
  thanks to your input and feedback.

  * Helpers

  New in this release is the support for helpers. Small utilities which enhance
  Lynis by providing a single goal. The first helper available is to audit
  Docker build files.

  * Improved OS support

  Many changes have been implemented to better support Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD
  DragonBSD and OpenBSD in particular. Upcoming releases will include smaller
  "improvement rounds" for other systems as well.

  * New technologies

  More utilities and technologies are supported now. Technologies and tools
  like systemd, Docker, nftables.

  * Lynis Enterprise

  As this code is shared, customers have an additional option to define to
  what server they want to upload the audit results. Also, commercial plugins
  have been bundled.

  * New parameters

  Several new options have been added:
  --dump-options (see all options)
  --report-file (define a different location for the report file)

  * General

  Documentation on the website has been extended: https://cisofy.com/support/
  The man page, Lynis binary and several tests have improved texts.

  This release is exceptional in that it includes many changes. We have done
  a lot of testing on different platforms. You could expect this software to be
  stable. Still, an assumption is no guarantee and especially no substitution
  for testing in your own environment. If you encounter issues, please report
  them via one of the links above in this changelog.


  Enjoy this new release!
